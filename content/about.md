SYNOPSIS
NAME
       ack-varmland — Engineering reliability, from kernel to cloud.

SYNOPSIS
       ack [OPTIONS] [TARGET_INFRASTRUCTURE]

DESCRIPTION
       Ack Värmland provides specialized Platform Engineering consultancy.
       Unlike standard consultancy daemons that just idle in the background,
       this process actively optimizes the entire OSI stack.

       Rooted in the stability of the Värmland soil, but operating at global
       scale (200M+ MAU). The core philosophy is based on "Servant Leadership"
       — empowering teams to clear obstacles rather than creating them.

OPTIONS
       --rescue
              Initiates the "Turnaround Protocol". Proven effective at EA
              for saving critical failing projects by restructuring backlogs
              and boosting team morale against all odds.

       --scale
              Deploys architecture capable of handling Minecraft-level traffic.
              Includes migration strategies (On-prem to Azure/AWS) that actually
              finish.

       --optimize
              Deep inspection of the stack. From tuning OS kernel parameters
              (Avanza) to streamlining CI/CD pipelines for 2000+ developers
              (Nasdaq).

       --mentor
              Runs in verbose mode. Shares knowledge via coaching programs
              (ZeBrain) and mentorship (Xbox MAP), ensuring the team grows
              alongside the codebase.

EXIT STATUS
       Returns 0 on success (Delivery Confirmed).
       Non-zero values indicate packet loss (Unacceptable).
